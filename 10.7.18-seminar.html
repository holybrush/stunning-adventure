<h1>Modeling traffic in large cites</h1>

<p>University of warsaw</p>

<p>Reason of traffic jams?
Demand>supply
Reduce number of cars?</p>

<p>Ride-sharing
How to match people optimally?
Predict demand?
Find best routes?
Optimal pricing strategy?</p>

<p>braess paradox
e.g. 4000 driver going from start to end
without a-b link time=65
with a-b link time=80
game theory: Nash equilibrium does not have to be a social optimum</p>

<p>build new roads:

Analysis
Prediction
optimization</p>

<p>traffic models:
1)  Macroscopic:
Models describe relation between speed, density and flow
Analogy to other physical phenomena, e.g. </p>

<p>2)  Mesoscopic
Vehicalues travel in homogenous”packets”</p>

<p>3)  Microscopic</p>

<p>Cellular automata
“Game of life”
Nagel-SchreckEnberg model (1992):
    1D microscopic model(1D probabilistic cellular automaton)
    1D tape divided into cells, cell’s length~7.5m
    Time and speed and discrete</p>

<p>Simulation
User interface</p>

<p>Application
1)  Traffic prediction
Typical/recurrent conditions (e.g. traffic in a morning peak)
    Short-term(e.g., 10-15 minutes ahead)
    Long ter(e.g., next day)
Traffic congestion/travels times
A lot of research</p>

<p>Melodic
“Intelligent Big Data Cloud”</p>

<p>Change traffic signal settings(AI with imagination)
TensorTraffic</p>

<p>Solution:
Values of a learning rate parameter
Droupout probability
Training time</p>
