# Modeling traffic in large cites
University of warsaw

        Reason of traffic jams?
        Demand>supply?
        Reduce number of cars?

        Ride-sharing
        How to match people optimally?
        Predict demand?
        Find best routes?
        Optimal pricing strategy?

        [braess paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess%27s_paradox)
        e.g. 4000 driver going from start to end
        without a-b link time=65
        with a-b link time=80
        game theory: Nash equilibrium does not have to be a social optimum

traffic models:
1)	Macroscopic:
Models describe relation between speed, density and flow
Analogy to other physical phenomena, e.g. 

2)	Mesoscopic
Vehicalues travel in homogenous”packets”

3)	Microscopic

Cellular automata
“Game of life”
Nagel-SchreckEnberg model (1992):
	1D microscopic model(1D probabilistic cellular automaton)
	1D tape divided into cells, cell’s length~7.5m
	Time and speed and discrete

Simulation
User interface

Application
1)	Traffic prediction
Typical/recurrent conditions (e.g. traffic in a morning peak)
 	Short-term(e.g., 10-15 minutes ahead)
 	Long ter(e.g., next day)
Traffic congestion/travels times
A lot of research

Melodic
“Intelligent Big Data Cloud”

Change traffic signal settings(AI with imagination)
TensorTraffic

Solution:
Values of a learning rate parameter
Droupout probability
Training time
